Library for DodoHand keyboard firmware
======================================
The keybrd_DH.ino sketch was written for the [DodoHand keyboard](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41422.0).

The keybrd_DH library is an extension of the [keybrd library](https://github.com/wolfv6/keybrd) for emulating the DataHand keyboard.

Everything you need to setup and run the keybrd_DH is in:
* [keybrd_library_user_guide](https://github.com/wolfv6/keybrd/doc/keybrd_library_user_guide.md)
* [tutorial_7a_using_someone_else's_keybrd_extension_library.md](https://github.com/wolfv6/keybrd/tutorials/tutorial_7a_using_someone_else's_keybrd_extension_library.md)
* [config.h](keybrd_DH/examples/keybrd_DH/config.h)

## Status
As of 7/18/16 the DodoHand hardware is 75% complete.

The firmware was Alpha tested on a breadboard keyboard.
The firmware is ready for Beta testing, but needs the DodoHand hardware for testing.
